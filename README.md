# cs50-flappy-bird
A remake of the original Flappy Bird game. Made with instructions from Harvard's CS50.

The first pair of pipes will be spawned between 2-5 seconds after the countdown (so it might feel a little long to wait). The minimum gap between the pair of pipes is still set to 90 pixels.

The game can be paused by pressing the enter key.

The gold medal is awarded for score greater than or equal to 10.
Silver for score greater than or equal to 5.
Bronze for score greater than or equal to 3.
No medal for 0 - 2.
